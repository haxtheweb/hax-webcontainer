# HAX Webcontainer
HAX setup to be used with a Webcontainer.io instance dynamically produced.

This is currently an experiment with a goal:
- Of using HAXcms / site technology without installation
- Go to a domain, HAXcms is running in a container, do whatever you want, it goes away

## Why?

- Demo and play with HAX without installing anything
- Ability to build, download and then take elsewhere
- Import existing sites in a sandbox so that you can have conversations around the tool
